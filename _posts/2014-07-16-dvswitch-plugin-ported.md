title: "DVSwitch Plugin Ported"
---

After months of working with Python, I'm suddenly working with C since two days. And I feel much older now :D Anyway, I had to do this in order to port [Gst Plugin DVSwitch] to Gstreamer 1.0 for porting Flumotion component.

Porting is complete and source builds successfully, but I still need to test the plugin.
