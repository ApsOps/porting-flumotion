title: "httpstreamer consumer problems"
---

I have been stuggling with httpstreamer for past two days now. The mood of httpstreamer component stays on "waking" and the reason seems "a discont on eater default" but I'm not sure about this. The whole DEBUG log is available [here].

I've git stashed the changes for now and started working on porting the audiotest producer, encoder and muxer.
