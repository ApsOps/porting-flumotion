title: "VP8 Encoder Ported"
---

I worked on porting the VP8 Encoder today. There were not many changes required, just that a few properties were removed and others' names were changed.

After porting was complete, I was able to watch a videotest stream encoded with VP8 encoder. Tomorrow I will be porting other encoders.
