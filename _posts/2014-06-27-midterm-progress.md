title: Midterm Progress

I just recieved the e-mail stating that I have passed the midterm evaluation for my project. Though I have been struggling with porting for about a week now, this gives me a bit of joy.

I've not been able to fix the problem(s) with overlay component and I have decided to port some other components first. I've started out with other encoder components.
