    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is <strong>Amanpreet Singh</strong> and I'm the <strong>Inglourious Coder ;)</strong> I just love to create awesome things with code and have equal parts interest in design, development and animation.</p>
    <p>I am an enthusiastic learner and fun loving guy currently pursuing M.Sc.&nbsp;(Hons.) Mathematics and B.E. (Hons.) Chemical Engineering at <a href="http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">BITS&nbsp;Pilani</a> which is located in a remote part of Rajasthan, India.</p>
    <p>I acquired some experience through personal, college and freelance projects. Thanks to the Dept. of Visual Media (previously CCTV) of BITS Pilani, I acquired other skills like the basics of development, project management and team work.</p>
    <p>I like to work through every creative step of a project, from brainstorming to graphic design including user experience to development and want to work for an awesome company. I even have a bit of entrepreneur in me, so that awesome company might be my own ;)</p>
